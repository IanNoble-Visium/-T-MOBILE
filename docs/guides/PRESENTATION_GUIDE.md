## Recommended Presentation Flow

### 1. Opening (2 minutes)

Start with the **Executive Dashboard** to immediately establish value proposition.

**Key talking points:**
- "This is the T-Mobile TruContext Intelligence Platform - a unified security operations center that combines T-Mobile's 5G Advanced Network with Visium's TruContext graph analytics."
- Point to the competitive radar chart: "As you can see, we significantly outperform Verizon and AT&T across all key metrics."
- Highlight the real-time threat feed: "This is live threat detection happening right now across the network."

### 2. The Game Changer - Cyber Defense Center (3 minutes)

Navigate to **Cyber Defense Center** dashboard.

**Key talking points:**
- "We're excited to announce our NEW Cyber Defense Center, launched just yesterday on October 15th, 2025."
- "This provides 24/7 threat detection, incident response, and digital forensics - capabilities that traditionally require separate vendors and systems."
- Show the active incidents table: "Our mean time to contain is just 12 minutes, compared to industry average of 45+ minutes."
- Highlight the response team status: "We have dedicated Tier 1 and Tier 2 analysts, incident commanders, and forensics specialists monitoring your environment around the clock."

### 3. SASE Platform Deep Dive (4 minutes)

Navigate to **SASE Platform** dashboard.

**Key talking points:**
- "Our SASE platform is powered by Palo Alto Networks Precision AI, detecting 8.95 million threats daily."
- Point to device distribution: "We support both T-SIMsecure for seamless mobile integration and traditional device clients."
- Highlight Precision AI section: "This is the differentiator - we detect never-before-seen threats in under 1 second with 99.8% accuracy."
- Show ZTNA enforcements: "Zero Trust Network Access is built-in, not bolted on. We're enforcing least-privileged access across all connections."

### 4. TruContext Advantage - Graph Analytics (3 minutes)

Navigate to **Graph Analytics** dashboard.

**Key talking points:**
- "This is where TruContext really shines. Traditional security tools look at events in isolation."
- "Our graph-based approach reveals hidden relationships between threats, users, devices, and applications."
- "We can trace multi-hop attack paths that would be invisible to traditional SIEM systems."
- "This means faster root cause analysis and proactive threat hunting."

### 5. IoT Security Hub (2 minutes)

Navigate to **IoT Security Hub** dashboard.

**Key talking points:**
- "With T-Mobile's leadership in IoT connectivity - NB-IoT, LTE-M, and 5G - we're protecting over 10,000 IoT devices."
- "Behavioral anomaly detection identifies compromised devices before they can be weaponized."
- "This is critical for industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and smart cities."

### 6. Closing - Return to Executive Dashboard (1 minute)

Navigate back to **Executive Dashboard**.

**Key talking points:**
- "Let me bring this all together. This platform delivers:"
  - **Speed**: 2-minute threat detection vs. 15-20 minutes for competitors
  - **Coverage**: 98% detection rate with Precision AI
  - **Cost**: $1M+ annual savings vs. traditional SIEM
  - **Innovation**: Graph analytics that reveal what others miss
- "And it's all delivered over T-Mobile's 5G Advanced Network with ultra-low latency."

## Handling Questions

### "How does this integrate with our existing tools?"

"The platform has REST APIs and supports standard integrations with SIEM, SOAR, and ticketing systems. We can ingest data from your existing tools and enrich it with TruContext analytics."

### "What about false positives?"

"Palo Alto's Precision AI has a 99.8% accuracy rate, which means extremely low false positives. Our Cyber Defense Center analysts also provide human validation for critical alerts."

### "Can we customize the dashboards?"

"Absolutely. These are the out-of-the-box dashboards, but we can customize KPIs, visualizations, and workflows to match your specific requirements and compliance needs."

### "What's the implementation timeline?"

"Typical deployment is 4-6 weeks for the SASE platform, with the Cyber Defense Center operational within 2 weeks. IoT integration depends on device count but averages 3-4 weeks."

### "How does pricing work?"

"We offer flexible pricing models - per-device, per-user, or consumption-based. The platform typically delivers ROI within 6 months through reduced security incidents and operational efficiency."

## Demo Tips

1. **Let the data speak**: The dashboards update in real-time. Pause occasionally to let attendees absorb the information.

2. **Use the sidebar**: Navigate smoothly between dashboards to show the breadth of capabilities.

3. **Highlight the "NEW" badge**: The Cyber Defense Center launch is a major differentiator.

4. **Point to specific numbers**: "2-minute detection time", "99.8% accuracy", "$1M savings" - concrete metrics resonate.

5. **Show competitive advantage**: The radar chart on the Executive Dashboard is powerful visual proof.

## Backup Plan

If internet connectivity fails:
- Have screenshots of each dashboard saved locally
- Prepare a PDF export of the key visualizations
- Be ready to walk through the architecture diagram instead

## Post-Demo Follow-Up

Offer to provide:
- Custom POC with their actual data
- Technical architecture review with their security team
- ROI analysis based on their current security spend
- Reference calls with existing customers

## Success Metrics

You'll know the demo was successful if attendees:
