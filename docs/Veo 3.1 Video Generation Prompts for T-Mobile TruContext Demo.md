## Video 7: SASE Platform Overview (12-15 seconds)
**Purpose**: Illustrate SASE architecture and zero trust security

**Prompt**:
```
Abstract visualization of a SASE security platform. Show remote workers, mobile devices, and cloud applications all connecting through a central security layer that glows with magenta light. Each connection is verified with zero trust authentication - visual checkpoints appear as data flows through. Threats attempting to breach the perimeter are detected by AI and blocked instantly, shown as red particles being deflected by a blue energy shield. Camera orbits around the architecture showing the comprehensive protection. Futuristic, professional style with smooth animations.
```

**Technical specs**: 15 seconds, 16:9 aspect ratio

## Video 8: Competitive Advantage Visualization (8-10 seconds)
**Purpose**: Show T-Mobile + TruContext superiority over competitors

**Prompt**:
```
Side-by-side comparison visualization. Three digital timers appear representing T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T. A simulated cyber threat is launched. T-Mobile's timer shows detection in 2 minutes with a bright magenta checkmark and "THREAT BLOCKED" confirmation. Verizon's timer reaches 15 minutes, AT&T reaches 20 minutes, both with slower, dimmer responses. T-Mobile's display shows additional metrics - higher accuracy, lower cost, better coverage - all outperforming competitors. Clean, data-driven visualization with professional graphics and T-Mobile magenta highlighting the winner.
