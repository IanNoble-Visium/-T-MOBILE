# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - SECURITY INCIDENT

## Critical Security Issue: Exposed Database Credentials

Your Neo4j database password was exposed in the GitHub repository and detected by GitGuardian.

---

## What Was Done ✅

1. **Identified exposed credentials:**
   - Neo4j password in `NEO4J_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
   - Neo4j password in `NEO4J_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`

2. **Redacted credentials from working files:**
   - Replaced passwords with `[REDACTED]` placeholders
   - Added security warnings to documentation

3. **Verified protection measures:**
   - `.env` is in `.gitignore` ✅
   - `.env.example` has placeholder values ✅
   - Current `.env` is not tracked in git ✅

---

## What You MUST Do NOW 🔴

### STEP 1: Rotate Neo4j Credentials (CRITICAL)

**Timeline: DO THIS IMMEDIATELY**

1. Go to https://console.neo4j.io
2. Log in to your account
3. Select your instance: `TMOBILE` (a52f4a1a)
4. Navigate to "Security" → "Credentials"
5. Click "Reset Password"
6. Copy the new password
7. Update your local `.env` file:
   ```
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=<NEW_PASSWORD_HERE>
   ```
8. **DO NOT COMMIT** the `.env` file to git

**Why:** The old password is publicly visible in GitHub history. Anyone can access your database.

---

### STEP 2: Clean Git History (CRITICAL)

**Timeline: DO THIS WITHIN 24 HOURS**

The exposed password is still in git history. You need to remove it:

**Option A: Using git filter-repo (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo
pip install git-filter-repo

# Create a redaction map file locally (DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE)
# Paste the leaked credential value from the GitGuardian alert on the left.
echo "<LEAKED_VALUE_FROM_GITGUARDIAN>==>[REDACTED]" > redactions.txt

# Remove the exposed password from history
git filter-repo --replace-text redactions.txt

# Force push to GitHub
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Option B: Using BFG Repo-Cleaner**

```bash
# Download from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
bfg --replace-text credentials.txt

# Force push to GitHub
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** This rewrites git history. All team members must pull the updated history.

---

### STEP 3: Notify Your Team

Tell all team members to:
1. Pull the latest changes
2. Update their local `.env` with the new Neo4j password
3. Clear their git reflog: `git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now`

---

## Additional Recommendations 🟡

### Rotate Other Credentials (Recommended)

1. **Google API Key:**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Delete old key, create new one
   - Update `.env`

2. **PostgreSQL Credentials:**
   - Go to Neon console
   - Reset password
   - Update `.env`

---

## Prevent This in the Future 🛡️

### Enable GitHub Secret Scanning

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Security & analysis"
3. Enable "Secret scanning"
4. Enable "Push protection"

This will prevent accidental commits of credentials.

---

## Verification

After completing all steps, verify:

```bash
# Check that the leaked credential (from GitGuardian) is removed from history
git log -p --all | grep "<LEAKED_VALUE_FROM_GITGUARDIAN>"
# Should return: (nothing)

# Check that .env is not in git
git ls-files | grep ".env"
# Should return: (nothing)

# Check that .env.example has no real credentials
cat .env.example
# Should show placeholder values only
```

---

## Timeline

- **Oct 16, 2025:** Credentials exposed in git commit
- **Oct 17, 2025:** GitGuardian alert received
- **Oct 17, 2025:** Credentials redacted from working files ✅
- **TODAY:** You must rotate credentials and clean history
- **Within 24 hours:** Git history must be cleaned
