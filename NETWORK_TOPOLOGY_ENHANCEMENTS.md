# Network Topology Visualization Enhancements

## Overview

Successfully fixed critical issues with the Network Topology Dashboard and implemented comprehensive graph layout options for enhanced visualization flexibility.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Disappearing Network Edges
**Problem:** Network edges (connections between nodes) were visible initially but disappeared after interaction.

**Root Cause:** The `hoveredNode` and `hoveredEdge` state variables were included in the `useEffect` dependency array, causing the entire D3 visualization to re-render whenever hover state changed. This destroyed and recreated the simulation, losing the edges.

**Solution:** 
- Converted hover state to use `useRef` instead of `useState`
- Removed hover states from the dependency array
- Created a separate `updateHoverState()` function to update opacity without re-rendering
- Used D3 data binding with key functions to preserve element identity

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/NetworkTopologyVisualization.jsx`

### 2. ✅ AIAnalyticsDashboard Error
**Problem:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` error in AIAnalyticsDashboard

**Root Cause:** The suggested queries format changed from categorized objects to simple strings, but the rendering code still expected the old format.

**Solution:**
- Added type checking to handle both old and new query formats
- Implemented conditional rendering for string vs. object queries
- Added fallback message when no queries are available

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/dashboards/AIAnalyticsDashboard.jsx`

## New Features: Multiple Graph Layouts

### Layout Options Implemented

#### 1. **Force-Directed Layout** (Default)
- Uses D3.js force simulation with physics-based positioning
- Nodes repel each other while edges pull connected nodes together
- Organic, natural-looking layout
- Best for: General network visualization, discovering relationships

#### 2. **Hierarchical Layout**
- Arranges nodes in vertical layers based on node type
- Data centers at top, cell towers below, etc.
- Tree-like structure for organizational clarity
- Best for: Understanding infrastructure hierarchy

#### 3. **Circular Layout**
- Positions all nodes in a circle
- Maintains edge connections
- Compact and symmetrical
- Best for: Viewing all nodes at once, presentations

#### 4. **Grid Layout**
- Arranges nodes in a structured grid pattern
- Calculated based on square root of node count
- Organized and predictable
- Best for: Systematic analysis, comparing node properties

#### 5. **Radial Layout**
- Central node (data center) at center
- Other nodes arranged in concentric circles
- Emphasizes central infrastructure
- Best for: Hub-and-spoke network analysis

### Implementation Details

**New File:** `src/lib/graphLayouts.js`
- Contains 5 layout algorithm implementations
- Each layout function takes nodes, edges, width, height
- Returns configured D3 force simulation
- Includes layout metadata and descriptions

**Updated Component:** `src/components/NetworkTopologyVisualization.jsx`
- Added `layout` prop to select active layout
- Integrated layout selector with visualization
- Maintains all existing features (drag, zoom, pan, alarms)
- Smooth transitions between layouts

**Updated Dashboard:** `src/components/dashboards/NetworkTopologyDashboard.jsx`
- Added layout state management
- Added layout selector dropdown in filters section
- Layout persists across filter changes
- Positioned alongside existing filters

### Features Preserved in All Layouts

✅ **Node Interactions**

- Hover for labels
- Alarm highlighting

✅ **Edge Interactions**
- Click to view connection details
- Hover highlighting

- Node labels on hover
- Color-coded by node type
- Responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Layout Algorithm Details

**Force-Directed:**
```javascript
- Link distance: 100px
- Link strength: 0.5
- Charge strength: -300
- Collision radius: 40px
```

**Hierarchical:**
```javascript
- Nodes grouped by type
- Vertical layer positioning
- Weak simulation for stability
- Charge strength: -50
```

**Circular:**
```javascript
- Radius: min(width, height) / 3
- Angle slice: 2π / nodeCount
- Minimal simulation
- Charge strength: -100
```

**Grid:**
```javascript
- Columns: ceil(sqrt(nodeCount))
- Cell-based positioning
- Minimal simulation
- Charge strength: -50
```

**Radial:**
```javascript
- Central node at center
- Concentric circle arrangement
- Ring-based positioning
- Charge strength: -100
```
