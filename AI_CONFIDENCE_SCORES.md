# AI Confidence Scores Implementation

## Overview
Added confidence percentage indicators to all Actionable Next Steps in the AI Analytics Dashboard to help identify which recommendations are based on strong evidence versus speculation, reducing the impact of AI hallucinations.

## What Was Changed

### Modified File: `server/services/gemini.js`

Updated the `explainResults()` function to instruct the AI to include confidence percentages (0-100%) with each actionable next step.

### Confidence Scale

The AI now uses the following confidence scale based on evidence:

- **90-100%**: Strong evidence directly from the query results
- **75-89%**: Good evidence with reasonable inferences  
- **60-74%**: Moderate evidence, some assumptions required
- **Below 60%**: Speculative or based on general best practices rather than specific data

### Output Format

Each actionable step is now formatted as:
```
**[Step Name] (Confidence: XX%):** Description
```

## Example Output

**Before:**
```
Actionable Next Steps:

1. Investigate Critical Threats: Prioritize analyzing the nature and source of the 10 critical 
   and 3 high-severity threats to identify specific attack patterns and potential vulnerabilities.
2. Prioritize Open Incidents: Urgently review and prioritize the 8 open incidents to ensure 
   timely resolution and prevent potential escalations or overlooked issues.
```

**After:**
```
Actionable Next Steps:

1. **Investigate Critical Threats (Confidence: 95%):** Prioritize analyzing the nature and source 
   of the 10 critical and 3 high-severity threats to identify specific attack patterns and potential 
   vulnerabilities.
2. **Prioritize Open Incidents (Confidence: 92%):** Urgently review and prioritize the 8 open 
   incidents to ensure timely resolution and prevent potential escalations or overlooked issues.
3. **Review Defenses (Confidence: 68%):** Continuously evaluate and update our threat intelligence 
   and blocking rules to maintain a robust defense against the observed high volume and severity 
   of threats.
```

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can see which recommendations are backed by solid data
2. **Risk Assessment**: Lower confidence scores flag recommendations that may need additional verification
3. **Hallucination Detection**: Helps identify when AI is speculating versus analyzing real data
4. **Decision Support**: Security teams can prioritize actions based on confidence levels

## How It Works

When the AI analyzes query results, it now:
1. Examines the actual data returned from the database
2. Assesses how directly each recommendation is supported by the evidence
3. Assigns a confidence score based on the strength of that evidence
4. Formats each step with the confidence percentage clearly displayed

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to the AI Analytics Dashboard
2. Ask a question about threats, incidents, or security status
3. Review the "Actionable Next Steps" section in the response
4. Verify that each step includes a confidence percentage
5. Check that higher confidence scores correspond to recommendations directly supported by the query results
